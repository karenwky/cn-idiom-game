# Sound Files

This folder contains sound effects for the game:

- `correct.wav` — Played when the player answers correctly
- `wrong.wav` — Played when the player answers incorrectly
- `game_over.wav` — Played when the game ends due to running out of lives
- `end_game.wav` — Played when all idioms are completed successfully

**Note:** Use WAV format for the best compatibility.

## Expand Sound Support

To support more sounds, add appropriate sound files to this folder and update the sound loading code in [`cn_idiom_game_pygame.py`](../../cn_idiom_game_pygame.py) as needed.
